## Getting to know me

My name is **Fozan Alfozan**, and im currenlty a student at *University College Dublin*. Im passionate about my major in **Computer Science**. I'm quite fascinated by how vast and interesting computers are. Computer science was my go-to major as I was exposed to it from a young age. My father got a PhD. in computer science, which introduced me to the world of computers as I was surrounded by it. In addition, my brother majored in computer engineering during college. 

I was born and raised in **Kuwait** my entire life. Recently I traveled to Dublin, Ireland to start my foundation year before entering college. Im currenlty doing a **computer homework** using *GitHub* by my kind teacher, **Mr. Stephen.**

I'm 17 years old, I plan on pursuing an independent life. My hobbies and interests are technology related things, listening to music and when im available, im also a video gamer. Recently i've been on a path of **self learning, seeking for success and happiness.**

A quote that I always go by:
> Work hard, Dream big.
